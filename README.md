## Introduction:

The New York City (NYC) Collision Dataset provides detailed records of motor vehicle collisions reported across the five boroughs of New York City. The dataset contains information such as date, time, location (borough, street), number of persons injured or killed, vehicle types involved, and contributing factors to each collision. This dataset is a valuable resource for understanding traffic patterns, identifying high-risk locations, and assessing the impact of road safety initiatives. Analyzing this data can help city planners, policymakers, and traffic enforcement agencies make data-driven decisions to reduce accidents and improve road safety.


## Key Metrics:

- Total Collisions – Total number of reported collisions within the selected time frame

- Collisions per Borough – Breakdown by borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, etc.)

- Collisions per Day/Month – Time-series trends to spot peak periods

- Severity Metrics

-  Contributing Factors

- Vehicle Involvement

- Location Insights

- Time-Based Metrics



## Summary:

Analysis of the NYC Collision Dataset reveals key trends and insights:

- Peak Collision Times: Most accidents occur during rush hours (morning and evening), with weekends often showing a slight increase in incidents.

- High-Risk Locations: Intersections in busy boroughs such as Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx consistently record higher collision counts.

- Common Contributing Factors: Driver inattention/distraction, failure to yield right-of-way, and unsafe speed are among the leading reported causes.

- Impact on Victims: The majority of incidents result in property damage only, but there are still a high significant number of injuries and a smaller proportion of fatalities each year.


These findings highlight both behavioral and infrastructural issues that contribute to collisions in NYC.

- Volume of Collisions: On average, there are over 10,000 reported collisions per month across NYC. With March showing 10.53%

- Peak Collision Times: Most collisions occur during rush hours — 7-9 AM and 4-7 PM — with an additional spike around late-night hours on weekends.

- High-Risk Boroughs: Brooklyn and Queens account for nearly 50% of all reported collisions, with Manhattan having the highest collision density due to traffic volume.

- Contributing Factors:

- Driver inattention/distraction accounts for 30% of all crashes.

-  Failure to yield right-of-way and following too closely are the next most common causes.

- Victim Impact:

8–10% involve injuries, and less than 1% result in fatalities each year.

- Vehicle Types: Passenger vehicles are most commonly involved, but there is a notable share of collisions involving taxis, trucks, and bicycles — highlighting multimodal traffic risks.


## Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, the following data-driven actions are recommended:

- Targeted Traffic Enforcement: Increase police presence and automated enforcement (speed/red-light cameras) in high-collision corridors, especially during rush hours.

- Improve Road Design: Redesign dangerous intersections with better signage, protected left-turn lanes, pedestrian islands, and clearer crosswalk markings.

- Driver Education Campaigns: Focus public awareness campaigns on distracted driving, speeding, and right-of-way violations — the top three contributors to crashes.

- Expand Data Collection: Enhance collision reporting to capture near-misses and more detailed driver behavior data for predictive modeling.

- Support Multimodal Safety: Install bike lanes, truck-only routes, and traffic-calming infrastructure to reduce conflict points between vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.

- Community Collaboration: Engage residents, schools, and businesses in traffic safety initiatives to build a culture of safer streets.
